This short film program is dedicated to the act of rebellion and the culture and people of Palestine, we have hand-picked this collection of unpredictable, highly crafted and  emotional short films to build our thematic focus for 2024. 

The filmmakers come from Palestine, Iran, Europe: but they are all bound by the desire to shine a much needed light on the human price Palestinians must pay in order to survive under Occupation. Nonetheless, humor, family and dignity fuel this special brand of resilience. Catch the shorts that reflect one of the most important moments in history.It seems to be pulling text from the first Shorts program too. Can you please adjust so it reflects the content of the Resistance program only.
