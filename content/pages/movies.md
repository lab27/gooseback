featuresDescription: Selected from some of our favorite film festivals from
  around the world, the feature film program reflects urgent and vital work by
  first-time directors, artist-turned-directors, and provocateurs. Drama,
  comedy, crime and the absurd unexpectedly collide and spark as much joy as
  they do intrigue over the three days of the festival. Many of these films are
  screening for the first (and only) time in Sweden.

Full program for the 2024 Gåsebäck Film Festival is live. 



We are super proud to present an expanded program of seven international feature and documentary films curated from some of the most vibrant film festivals in the world. We are excited by the condition of independent film right now. In our programming we are excited to help launch new films by first time directors, artists-turned directors, and established filmmakers make up a program of provocateurs, thinkers and protestors all with something vital to say about the world we live in. 



For 2024 we are launching a new short film section. These programs are dedicated to screening cutting edge work from the best of emerging talent from Sweden and around the world. Our audiences will be some of the first to see brand new works by Skåne-based filmmakers presenting very well crafted and gripping stories of modern love, deciple vs discipline and the pursuit of self-knowledge. These world class films screen along side hits from Sundance, Cannes and other well known film events. 



As we viewed many hundereds of films over the last year, we were struck by so many beautiful and urgent films that tackled the theme of resistance. Art, moving image, sharing stories, are some the most powerful forms of resistance, and we felt compelled to celebrate the human urge to stand up against injustice through our dedicate program called Resistance. Here we focus on films about Palestine. A collection of short films, feature and documentary films illuminate the beauty of Palestinian culture and Palestinian people by sharing stories around brave and complex characters and rediscovering personal and political narratives that invite viewers to imagine a new reality for Palestine. 



Also new in 2024 are our Audience Prize's. After every screening audiences are invite to vote for their favorite short and feature film. After the votes are counted, the festival will announce the winner of the Audience Prize and give these films a boost into the world, and hoping edge them one step closer towards distribution. 



Do not miss you chance to catch these very special films in a unique and intimate cinema setting. Your support is appreciated.
