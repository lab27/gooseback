featuresDescription: "The 2025 Gåsebäck Film Festival program is live!   We are
  thrilled to share a collection of some of the best international feature films
  and documentaries of the year with our audiences.   We are thrilled to be
  partnering with Röda Kvarn this year to present our program.   A special focus
  on Helsingborg-based filmmakers is one of our center piece programs, playing
  on Saturday August 30th, while a special of music themed documentaries will
  also play to celebrate impact-lead filmmaking. Following on in the music
  focus, we will be hosting a music video making workshop for young directors in
  collaboration with Fryshusset on Saturday August 30th. Finally, we are
  thrilled to announce Hel’s Kitchen:  a brand new film market that launches a
  collection of brand new films in development stage, all taking place at
  Vagnhall 16.  In 2025 we open the festival with The Editorial Office, a
  Ukrainian made satire about a journalist in the midst of government corruption
  - a funny and poignant mirror to our times. The Swedish premiere of The Black
  Sea from SXSW celebrates the true spirit of independent filmmaking, with
  directors Crystal Moselle and Derrick B. Harden present for a Q&A. The
  Innocents presented its international premiere from its award winning launch
  at Guadalajara Film Festival,  while The Architect will be launched with the
  director and cast present for a Q&A.   Fresh voices with something to say
  about the world we live in are alive and well. Check out the program and do
  not miss the chance to see daring new works, many presented for the first time
  in Sweden. "

helsingborgDescription: " A raucous, sometimes cantankerous, black-comedy loving
  and form-challenging deep dive into some of the best emerging filmmaking
  talent from Sweden, and Skåne in particular, and around this weird, wild, wide
  world. Shorts Program 2: Short Program 2: Resistance - Dedicated to the act of
  rebellion and the culture and people of Palestine, we have hand-picked this
  collection of unpredictable, highly crafted and  emotional short films to
  build our thematic focus for 2024. The filmmakers come from Palestine, Iran,
  Europe: but they are all bound by the desire to shine a much needed light on
  the human price Palestinians must pay in order to survive under Occupation.
  Nonetheless, humor, family and dignity fuel this special brand of resilience.
  Catch the shorts that reflect one of the most important moments in history."
