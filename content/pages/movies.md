  thrilled to share our specially selected collection of some of the best
  international feature films and documentaries of the year with Helsingborg’s
  audiences.   While many of our events are in Gåsebäck, for 2025 we are
  thrilled to be partnering with Röda Kvarn to present our film program.   A
  center piece to our program is our special focus on Helsingborg-based
  filmmakers playing on Saturday August 30th. We are proud to present a
  celebration of talent in our city and can not wait to share their films with a
  home town audience. Be sure to get your tickets to connect with these new
  films and meet the filmmakers too.   Our themed program pursues music and
  documentary film. We are thrilled to present the premiere of Bill Preston:
  Thats The Way God Planned in Sweden, as well as Do It Yourself: Michel Gondry
  and Fakk The Sistem, a short punk music doc to top it off. Music represents a
  way to reach a wide variety of audiences, especially younger audiences. To
  deepen our connection to the creative community we will be hosting a music
  video workshop for young directors in collaboration with Fryshusset on
  Saturday August 30th.   Finally, we are thrilled to announce Hel’s Kitchen:  a
  brand new film market that launches a collection of brand new films in
  development stage, all taking place at Vagnhall 16. Projects from the UK, USA
  and Sweden will be presented with industry professionals who are eager to
  connect with the newest filmmaking talent out there.  This year we open the
  festival program with The Editorial Office, a Ukrainian made satire about a
  journalist in the midst of a corruption scandal is a funny and poignant mirror
  to our times. The Swedish premiere of The Black Sea from SXSW celebrates the
  true spirit of independent filmmaking, with directors Crystal Moselle and
  Derrick B. Harden present for a Q&A. The Innocents presented its international
  premiere from its award winning launch at Guadalajara Film Festival,  while
  The Architect will be launched with the director and cast present for a
  Q&A.   Fresh voices with something to say about the world we live in are alive
  and well. Check out the program and do not miss the chance to see daring new
  works, many presented for the first time in Sweden. "
