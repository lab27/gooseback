featuresDescription: Full program for the 2024 Gåsebäck Film Festival is
  live.   We are super proud to present an expanded program of seven
  international feature and documentary films curated from some of the most
  vibrant film festivals in the world. We are excited by the condition of
  independent film right now. In our programming we are excited to help launch
  new films by first time directors, artists-turned directors, and established
  filmmakers make up a program of provocateurs, thinkers and protestors all with
  something vital to say about the world we live in.   For 2024 we are launching
  a new short film section. These programs are dedicated to screening cutting
  edge work from the best of emerging talent from Sweden and around the world.
  Our audiences will be some of the first to see brand new works by Skåne-based
  filmmakers presenting very well crafted and gripping stories of modern love,
  deciple vs discipline and the pursuit of self-knowledge. These world class
  films screen along side hits from Sundance, Cannes and other well known film
  events.   As we viewed many hundereds of films over the last year, we were
  struck by so many beautiful and urgent films that tackled the theme of
  resistance. Art, moving image, sharing stories, are some the most powerful
  forms of resistance, and we felt compelled to celebrate the human urge to
  stand up against injustice through our dedicate program called Resistance.
  Here we focus on films about Palestine. A collection of short films, feature
  and documentary films illuminate the beauty of Palestinian culture and
  Palestinian people by sharing stories around brave and complex characters and
  rediscovering personal and political narratives that invite viewers to imagine
  a new reality for Palestine.   Also new in 2024 are our Audience Prize's.
  After every screening audiences are invite to vote for their favorite short
  and feature film. After the votes are counted, the festival will announce the
  winner of the Audience Prize and give these films a boost into the world, and
  hoping edge them one step closer towards distribution.   Do not miss you
  chance to catch these very special films in a unique and intimate cinema
  setting. Your support is appreciated.
shorts1Description: " A raucous, sometimes cantankerous, black-comedy loving and
  form-challenging deep dive into some of the best emerging filmmaking talent
  from Sweden, and Skåne in particular, and around this weird, wild, wide world.
  Shorts Program 2: Short Program 2: Resistance - Dedicated to the act of
  rebellion and the culture and people of Palestine, we have hand-picked this
  collection of unpredictable, highly crafted and  emotional short films to
  build our thematic focus for 2024. The filmmakers come from Palestine, Iran,
  Europe: but they are all bound by the desire to shine a much needed light on
  the human price Palestinians must pay in order to survive under Occupation.
  Nonetheless, humor, family and dignity fuel this special brand of resilience.
  Catch the shorts that reflect one of the most important moments in history."
