shorts1Description: " A raucous, sometimes cantankerous, black-comedy loving and
  form-challenging deep dive into some of the best emerging filmmaking talent
  from Sweden, and Skåne in particular, and around this weird, wild, wide world.
  Shorts Program 2: Short Program 2: Resistance - Dedicated to the act of
  rebellion and the culture and people of Palestine, we have hand-picked this
  collection of unpredictable, highly crafted and  emotional short films to
  build our thematic focus for 2024. The filmmakers come from Palestine, Iran,
  Europe: but they are all bound by the desire to shine a much needed light on
  the human price Palestinians must pay in order to survive under Occupation.
  Nonetheless, humor, family and dignity fuel this special brand of resilience.
  Catch the shorts that reflect one of the most important moments in history."
