For the first time in Helsingborg, a new collection of photographic works by Malmö photographer Gary Ellejberg will be on display at the festival cinema. 

Portraits and documentary enquiries, taken from around Europe come together to explore the idea of lesbian spaces, and the question: where have all the lesbians gone? Each picture carries a conversation around identity and belonging in a rapidly evolving world, while revealing states of vulnerability, joy and resistance. Gry will be present in Helsingborg for the festival and will conduct a special artist conversation on Friday August 30 at 16:00. 

All photos are available for acquisition.
