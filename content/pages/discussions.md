The 2024 edition of Gåsebäck Film Festival introduces a new section dedicated to important industry conversations. For emerging and working filmmakers in the region, these live discussions are designed to share knowledge and experience from film professionals to ensure our creators are informed and up to date on emerging trends in the industry. 

This year we are proud to welcome Malmö based producer, Basel Mawlawi. A creator of tv, series and film, Basel's experience means he knows a good story when he hears. But the challenges facing the industry right now, from production funding to shifting sands in distribution, means new ways to finance and launch independent works need to be explored. In this 45 min conversation Basel shares his journey into film, and what he sees as the next steps for the future of media in our region.
