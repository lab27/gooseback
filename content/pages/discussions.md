The 2024 edition of Gåsebäck Film Festival introduces a new section dedicated to important industry conversations. For emerging and working filmmakers in the region, these live discussions are designed to share knowledge and experience from film professionals to ensure our creators are informed and up to date on emerging trends in the industry. 

From The Gut: Gry Ellejberg is a Malmö based artist, photographer and storyteller. Gry’s newest exhibition, From The Gut, will be presented from Friday August 30 until Sunday September 1st. The show explores the question: where are all the lesbians? Gry explores hidden spaces across Europe and shares her encounters through portraits, documentary stills, and text, to illustrate the liminal space lesbian and queer sensibility thrives in today’s world. Our conversation will touch on the origins of Gry’s journey, craft, and approach, as we break down the nuances of space and identity in a rapidly shifting culture that eludes definition. This session will include time for questions with the audience.

Friday August 30th 16:00 - 16.30

This year we are proud to welcome Malmö based producer, Basel Mawlawi. A creator of tv, series and film, Basel's experience means he knows a good story when he hears. But the challenges facing the industry right now, from production funding to shifting sands in distribution, means new ways to finance and launch independent works need to be explored. In this 45 min conversation Basel shares his journey into film, and what he sees as the next steps for the future of media in our region.

Resistance:


The festival is very happy to welcome director, actor and producer, [Omar Shargawi](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1494245/), from Copenhagen. Omar will attend the festival as part of our Resistance program to discuss his work as a Palestine/Danish director operating in the current political and creative climate, and to share thoughts on his newest work that focussed on the Palestinian diaspora. The special in-converstaion will cover creative questions as well as industry nuance as we break down the realities of making fictional and non-fictional works with Palestinian themes and explore how filmmaking can in itself be an act of resistance. The conversation will be moderated by Hussain Currimbhoy and will allow for questions from the audience. Reservations are recommended  as seating is limited.
