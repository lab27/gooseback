Gåsebäck Film Festival enters its 3rd edition in 2025. 

We are the only film festival event in Helsingborg, Sweden. Our program is dedicated to showcasing a collection of some of the best international cinema from independent creators to the city. We celebrate new works of narrative film, feature documentary and two programs of short films by international and local emerging creators for our city’s diverse audiences. A key part of the programming is about filmmakers. We love to welcome filmmakers, producers and other film creatives to the city and invite them to host Q&As after their screening. And in some cases host masterclasses and in-conversation sessions with them learn about their creative journeys into filmmaking, to share skills, build the filmmaking community in Helsingborg. 

The festival takes place from August 28 to August 31st in Gåsebäck and in venues around the city. The festival is supported by Film i Skåne, Helsingborg Stad, and Master Mechanic Films AB. But we also get by with a little help from our friends at Fryshuset, Vagnhall 16, Mindpark and Boost HBG as well as other creative partners in the city who are dedicated to elevating culture in our city. 

Program launch is scheduled for 1st week of August 2025. Follow us out on social media for program updates. 

Team:

The festival was founded and run by producer and director [Hussain Currimbhoy](https://hussain.studio/) executive director of  [Master Mechanic Films](https://mastermechanicfilms.com/).
