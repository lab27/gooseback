Introducing Hel’s Kitchen: a new discovery/ pitching initiative designed to help emerging filmmakers connect with industry professionals. 

Our goal is to create a unique space in the region for creators with feature film works in development to secure the creative partnerships needed to take their projects to the next level. 

As part of the Gåsebäck Film Festival in Helsingborg, Sweden, Hel’s Kitchen was born from a need to highlight and support new independent film voices from Sweden and around Europe. Through a rigorous submission process we present a specially curated selection of feature film projects, from narrative to documentary to hybrid, and animation, at varying stages of development or production to our invited industry guests.  

Throughout, we ensure that diverse and compelling storytelling thrives at the heart of the selection to help the next generation of filmmakers get their films to the screen.

Hel’s Kitchen will take place on Saturday, August 30th in Helsingborg, bringing together a handpicked group of industry professionals - from producers, to festival programmers to funders - to meet our selected filmmakers. 

At Hel’s Kitchen, selected filmmakers are given a platform to:

* Present  their projects during a guided conversation. Filmmakers are invited to  share clips of their film or parts of their script.
* Filmmakers are offered a chance to discuss their vision and filmmaking process in depth, and outline the current needs of their projects. 
* Take questions from industry professionals in a public setting.
* Build meaningful connections with industry professionals, opening doors to new partnerships and future opportunities.
*

Hel’s Kitchen also features masterclasses and in-depth conversations around craft with attending filmmakers and industry partners. We aim to foster knowledge-sharing and the exploration of new ways to collaborate. Programming also includes networking events designed to spark meaningful connections and lasting friendships.
