Guru, a young man in his twenties, works in a call center in Agra. In love with Mala, a work colleague, he stills lives with his parents, whose house is divided in two parts. Guru lives on the ground floor with his mother while his father is upstairs with his mistress. when Guru announces that he wants to marry Mala, and make the terrace of the house his future bedroom, nothing goes as planned. Frustrations, faults and family hatreds come to light, symptoms of an Indian patriarchal society with many taboos.



Behl’s gift as a storyteller is his ability to plunge the viewer often into the ghastliest of circumstances and make us consider the histories and shadows of such acts; domino-like effects wildly spiral out into bracing comments on how relationships are curdled and re-negotiated, the particularity of location within which we operate and their equation to why we do what we do.
