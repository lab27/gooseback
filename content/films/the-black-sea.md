After answering a strange online ad, Derrick, a young American artist leaves behind the chaos of New York City for a remote coastal town on the edge of Eastern Europe. As the only African American man for miles, he is met with a mix of curiosity and quiet reserve. A temporary escape slowly unfolds into something more complex â€” a delicate negotiation between solitude and connection, displacement and belonging. A fresh and surprising investigation into redisovering yourself, Derrick is the embodiment of a the philosophy that insists: If you can not find community, create it.
