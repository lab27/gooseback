While pregnant with her second child, Kika faces the sudden death of her partner. Totally heartbroken, and broke, she sets her priorities straight : 1.⁠ ⁠make money fast 2.⁠ ⁠stay strong. Dirty underwear, dildos and neurotic parents will unexpectedly help. As a social worker, Kika is used to helping others. But now she could use some help herself: 

Direct from Critics Week at Cannes Film Festival 2025, Alex Poukine’s new film carves an emotional path of self-discovery that straddles the line between lust and fragility.
