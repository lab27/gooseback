​Ann, a morose New Yorker in her 30s, feels stuck in all areas of her life. To her dismay, the years have gone by quickly in her long-term casual BDSM relationship, low-level corporate job, and quarrelsome Jewish family. As she begins to feel increasingly alienated, she wrestles with herself and her relationships in this self-deprecating auto-fictional comedy and feature debut from writer/director/actor Joanna Arnow.

A Deceptively Plain Masterpiece - Richard Brody, The New Yorker.
