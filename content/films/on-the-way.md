Based on true events, filmmaker and he's son (Miron 13), collaborate on a script that weaves their personal experiences and autobiographical elements with broader concerns about their country.

They are on their way to the airport to receive a gift sent from abroad by the son's godfather. Amid bureaucratic obstacles, with little or no hope for real political and social changes in the country, this brief journey evolves into a profound exploration of their bond against the backdrop of societal challenges and the uncertainty looming over their future.
