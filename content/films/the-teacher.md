A Palestinian school teacher (Saleh Bakri) struggles to reconcile his life-threatening commitment to political resistance with his emotional support for one of his students (Muhammad Abed ElRahman) and the chance of a new romantic relationship with a volunteer worker (Imogen Poots).

'Nabulsi... has a sure grasp of emotional give-and-take and day-to-day realities. At the core of her movie are three compelling performances, led by the striking and understated intensity of Saleh Bakri (who starred in Nabulsi’s Oscar-nominated short, The Present).'
