After sixty years of marriage, Elias and Christiane live together without actually living with each other. Eliasâ€™s illness has forced him into a solitary world, while Christiane's obligations, responsibilities, and routines lock her in a lonely world of her own. Their love resides in their shared memories. As they delve into those stories from the past, they prepare for a final farewell with an attempt to reconnect one last time. They will find themselves in a world where time stands still, where the atmosphere is warm and the music from their first encounter resounds about them.
