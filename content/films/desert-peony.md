In a sprawling mega city where the dangers of climate change are present not future, acclaimed filmmaker Rahul Jain shows a world on the brink. 
Delivered though a unique approach to aesthetics and politics  and eye opening accounts from everyday citizens, Invisible Demons arrives as a visceral and immersive journey through the stories of just a few of Delhi's 30 million inhabitants fighting to survive. Jain explores his home city as an experiential engagement, offering a new perspective on its subject: the clear and present climate reality. Jain places viewers in a space where timeframes collide, addressing the audiences senses by directly stimulating our desire to live in a world with equitable access to clean air and water. Is it possible to imagine this future in Delhi, in India, or anywhere in the modern world?

Followed by live Q&A with the director, Rahul Jain
