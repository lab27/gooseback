A family that raises meat rabbits invites viewers to follow the journey of a litter of bunnies from nest to pot.As summer turns to winter, it's time for the rabbits to become foodâ€”the meat harvest begins. Would you have the guts to kill in order to eat meat?

The Documentary challenges viewers to reflect on the life of an animal before it becomes meat, and to consider its origins. In today's society, is it acceptable to eat a cute animal, or are concepts like utility pets and self-sufficiency merely relics of the past?
