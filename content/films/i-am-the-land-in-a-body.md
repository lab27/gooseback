A stark but riveting journey into the West Bank, this short documentary  traces the every day life of Sheikh Suleiman Al-Hathalin, a Palestinian at the forefront of settler-colonial operations who resists the Occupation in his own way. The only goal is to protect the land of his ancestors and preserve his homeland from confiscation. Israeli police defend incursions and do not recognize Suleiman as person who lives and works this land. As a result  Suleiman pays for his protest with his life.
