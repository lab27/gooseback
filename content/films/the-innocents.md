Cara de Ángel is a sensitive teenager in search of his identity, trying to understand what it means to be a man in a world shaped by hostile masculinity. To earn a place in the neighborhood pack and prove his manhood, he joins a robbery; they plan to break into the house of a man they want revenge on. Driven by sexual desire, he explores his connection with Gabriela, a girl from the neighborhood he believes he’s in love with, and Jhonny, the lead singer of a punk band he deeply admires. His impulsive, hormone-fueled choices lead him into betrayal and mark the end of his innocence.[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innocents_(2025_film)#cite_note-ficg-1)
