**\
It was circumstance (screendance and curatorial) that took the filmmakers to Indonesia, where time was allocated to connect with the Punk scene in Bandung. Providing some documentary material about Anti Cimex was expected. But a much more personal exploration of the punk scene emerged, and a film was born. Our quest was to search for the imprint of the Swedish punk group Anti Cimex in today's Indonesian punk scene from the point of view of Skånberg's performance persona.**
