Michel Gondry is a creative genius who is best known for his brilliantly cinematic music videos, scripts and film direction. Michel is a filmmaker and artist who’s always done things his own quirky way. Gondry started out making super imaginative music videos for big names like Björk, Daft Punk, and The White Stripes. His playful, handmade style caught Hollywood’s attention, and he went on to direct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, winning an Oscar and becoming one of the few French filmmakers to do so.

For over 30 years, Michel Gondry has shown us how to turn everyday stuff into amazing stories. His work feels like magic—mixing music, dreams, childhood memories, and DIY tricks to create something totally unique. This feature documentary traces his life and work, and represents a rare peek inside the mind of one the world's most surprising filmmakers. Whether he’s working with cardboard sets or big movie stars, his message stays the same: use your hands, trust your imagination, and make the world a little more wonderful.
