After living as a drifting poet for 30 years, Zeng Dekuang went back to his birthplace, Coal Dam, located in a closed state-owned coal mine in southern China. Life has undergone tremendous changes, and the line between reality and memories gets blurry. Two poet friends He Lu and Guan Dangsheng came to visit him. They wander together among the debris. In aimless wandering and personal memories, a hidden historical wound is presented. 32 years ago, as a student leader, Zeng's life changed greatly because of his participation in the democratic movement in1989. Summer passed into fall, Poet Zeng couldn't extricate himself in the continuous drizzle of late autumn. He had to fight against the nihility of life.
