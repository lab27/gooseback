Shot on 16mm, this Cornish folk horror film unfolds on an uninhabited island in the Celtic Sea where a wildlife volunteer’s daily observations of a rare flower takes a dark turn into the strange and metaphysical. Jostling between dreams and reality, between cinematic and Cornish folklore, what we encounter is a  richly authentic portrait of Cornwall -  an ancient yet fresh land defined by working class industry locked in an elemental struggle with the sea and driven by a palpable sense of the past underpinning the future. ENYS MEN means ’stone island’. But this  dreamy, measured, haunted tale of what lies between myth and reality will mean something very different for everyone. Sparse, naturalist and often times sublime, Mark Jenkin’s second feature is a highly unusual but fascinating cinematic experience that establishes  a new and exciting voice in British cinema. 

A﻿ pre-recorded Q&A with the director from BFI London Film Festival 2022 will be screened after the film.
