Shirley, an eighty-three-year-old East Texan widow becomes infatuated with Marvin, a younger married man she meets at the Cowboy Church. Their relationship begins innocently, but Shirley’s son Dean and daughter-in-law Debbie worry that their lonely mother is misreading Marvin’s light banter.

Shirley imagines Marvin as the “Marlboro Man” of her childhood fantasies—a handsome, hard-working cowboy wreathed in smoke. But when Shirley’s advances become too frequent, the situation escalates into a confrontation between Marvin and Dean in the pastor’s office.

Undeterred, Shirley continues to reach out to her “special friend,” but when Marvin files a restraining order, Shirley becomes convinced that her beloved Marlboro Man was actually a “no good snake-in-the-grass.” Was Marvin’s treachery only in Shirley’s imagination, or can she sense his true nature?
