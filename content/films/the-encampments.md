*The Encampments* chronicles the Columbia University Gaza solidarity encampments that began in April 2024. as students faced police raids, media attacks, and political condemnation, their movement spread to universities across the world. Through exclusive footage and intimate interviews, *The Encampments* captures the passion, resilience, and challenges faced by students who risked everything to demand justice. The documentary includes access to the student organizers at several encampments, and a whistleblower from high-up in the administration of an ivy league university who reveals the tactics that institutions took to discredit the calls of their own students. Mahmoud Khalil, the US permanent resident who the trump administration has since moved to deport for his role in the protests despite not being charged with a crime, features prominently.
