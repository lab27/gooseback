Two sisters, Rojin, who laments the unexplained disappearance of her fiancé during the war and her older sister Shilan, who struggles with her oppressive husband. In order to avoid Shilan’s fate of forced marriage, Rojin must pass the university entrance exam. The path to success, however, is a tricky path laden with legally and morally contentious decisions. Delicate framing and subtle performances illustrate the heartbreaking reality in which higher education is the only possible salvation for the more vulnerable parts of Middle Eastern society, a factor that is readily exploited by swindlers. Acclaimed Iraqi-Kurdish director scrutinizes women rights and women's living conditions in the Middle East, creating a striking metaphor for the individual and their struggle to grow within a corrupt  system, itself struggling to rebuild. A festival and award winning hit, The Exam was Iraq’s entry to the Oscars in 2022.
