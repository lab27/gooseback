The rise in the production and consumption of corn in the American diet is a complex and multifaceted issue that has had a significant impact on both the food industry and American society as a whole. This panel discussion will explore the various factors that have contributed to the proliferation of corn in the American diet, the effects it has had on health and the environment, and the various perspectives on this trend.

One of the main drivers of the increased production and consumption of corn in the American diet is the advancement in agricultural technology which allowed for larger yields, and the government policies that have heavily subsidized corn growers. Additionally, corn is widely used as an ingredient in processed foods and as feed for livestock, leading to it becoming a ubiquitous presence in the American diet.

However, this increased dependence on corn has also led to a host of negative consequences, such as a rise in obesity and diabetes, and damage to the environment, as the monoculture of corn and heavy use of pesticides have had detrimental effects on soil health, water and air.

The panel discussion will feature experts in agriculture, nutrition, and food science, who will discuss the complex issues surrounding the rise of corn in the American diet, including the impact on the health, economy, and environment. They will also share the perspectives of small farmers and the alternative options available to change the way we consume corn and create a more sustainable food system.

Overall, this panel discussion will provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the rise in the production and consumption of corn in the American diet, and the perspectives from industry experts and stakeholders, as well as potential solutions for a more sustainable food system.
