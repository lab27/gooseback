Malmö based producer, Basel Mawlawi, has operated in the film industry for over 20 years, starting in his native Syria and now in Sweden. Basel’s work has spanned feature documentary, television, and shows for streaming platforms. In this wide ranging conversation, Basel will outline his work as a producer and offer his commentary on producing cutting edge, creative works in the new climate of film funding in Sweden (and Europe). With an industry is one of its greatest states of flux in recent years, this is a must-attend conversation for those wishing to enter the film industry, or for current practitioners interested in producing independent works for distribution.
