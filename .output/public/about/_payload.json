We celebrate new works of narrative film, feature documentary and two programs of short films by international and local emerging creators for our city’s diverse audiences. A key part of the programming is about filmmakers. We love to welcome filmmakers, producers and other film creatives to the city and invite them to host Q&As after their screening. And in some cases host masterclasses and in-conversation sessions with them learn about their creative journeys into filmmaking, to share skills, build the filmmaking community in Helsingborg. ",{"type":31,"tag":32,"props":43,"children":44},{},[45],{"type":36,"value":46},"The festival takes place from August 28 to August 31st in Gåsebäck and in venues around the city.
