Our program is dedicated to showcasing a collection of some of the best international cinema from independent creators to the city. We celebrate new works of narrative film, feature documentary and two programs of short films by international and local emerging creators for our city’s diverse audiences. A key part of the programming is about filmmakers. We love to welcome filmmakers, producers and other film creatives to the city and invite them to host Q&As after their screening. And in some cases host masterclasses and in-conversation sessions with them learn about their creative journeys into filmmaking, to share skills, build the filmmaking community in Helsingborg. "}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The festival takes place from August 28 to August 31st in Gåsebäck and in venues around the city.
